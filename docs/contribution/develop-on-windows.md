# Develop on Windows

NOTE: If you missed [Getting Started](getting-started.md), go ahead and read it.

Since you installed VSCode and Docker, and cloned your fork, you can now open it!

## Open Cloned Repo in VSCode

Since we're using VSCode in this tutorial, we'll show you how to set it up.

* Open up VSCode, click the open folder button, and select the directory you cloned earlier
* Follow [VSCode Setup](visual-studio-code-setup.md), then come back
  * Make sure you install the Remote Development Pack!
* Make sure Docker is running, hit F1, and select Reopen In Container
* You are now in the Docker container in VSCode
  * Open VSCode's integrated terminal so you can use necessary commands. Use the command `main` to start Permasigner.
